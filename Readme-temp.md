What you need to do for deployment:
Create production env on the EC2 hosting the Flutter web build with:
API base: pass --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://hynorvixx.com when building.
Ensure backend CORS allows your frontend origin (e.g., https://hynorvixx.com or https://app.hynorvixx.com).
Optional: Configure global 404 route in Flutter as desired.
Notes:
Existing UI routes remain (/login, /signup, /gallery, /upload).
Upload flow expects the backend to return S3 presigned url and photoId; adjust keys if your backend differs.
If you want, I can run a quick manual smoke test against https://hynorvixx.com from your environment.
